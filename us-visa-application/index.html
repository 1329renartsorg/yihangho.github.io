Please refer to the website of the nearest US Embassy for more information.</p><p>As a result of winning the D-Code bootcamp, I was invited to attend another bootcamp in San Francisco, and as we all know, the first step to visit the US is to get a visa.</p><p>The very first step in applying for a US visa is to determine the type of visa that you need. According to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_visas>Wikipedia</a> there are about 185 types of visa for you to choose. But for most of the time, you will need non-immigrant B1/B2 visa.</p><p>To apply for almost any type of visa, you have to fill in an electronic form known as DS-160. As soon as you started filling in this form, you will be given an application ID. You should jot down this ID as you will need it to retrieve your incomplete form if you stop half-way. DS-160 basically asks for your personal information, purpose of your travel, family information and finally some security information. At the end of the form, you need to upload your photograph. After you have done everything, you will be shown a confirmation page. You should print this confirmation page as you will be asked to hand in this confirmation page during your interview. It is not difficult to fill in DS-160 as long as you have all the information needed. It took me about two hours to finish filling in the form.</p><p>Next, you will need to pay for the visa application fee. For the US Embassy in Malaysia, the payment is to be made at any Standard Chartered bank. For the B1/B2 visa that I am applying for, the fee is $160, paid in local currency, in my case, Malaysian Ringgit. Before you visit the bank, you should check the current currency exchange at the embassy website, and also, you have to print a copy of deposit slip and bring it to the bank. Each deposit slip has an expiry date, make sure the one that you are bringing to the bank is still valid. Also, you should take jot down your passport number as you will need it to make the payment.</p><p>Now, you are ready to schedule for an appointment. Make sure you have your DS-160 application ID and also your visa fee payment receipt. Just follow the instruction on the website and you are good to go. You will be asked to select how your passport should be delivered to you. Just pick a convenient method for you. Finally, you will be shown the appointment confirmation letter. Print this letter.</p><p>At the day of the interview, arrive as early as possible. For me, my interview slot was at 8:20 a.m., but I arrived at 7:00 a.m. When you arrive, you might already see a long line of queue. Talk to the security guard and he/she will tell you what to do. Then you will be asked to walk to another guard post. Show the guard your appointment confirmation letter and your driving licence and he will give you a visitor pass. You will have to move to another queue, waiting to enter the compound of the embassy.</p><p>As you enter the embassy, your belongings will be checked, and certain items like mobile phones, car keys and chargers have to be surrendered.</p><p>Next, you will be approached by another security guard (Yup, there are so many security guards that you might start wondering at this point if the embassy is run by security guards.) and he will give you a number and usher you to a waiting room where you can sit and wait for your number to be called.</p><p>Your number will be called three times. For the first time it is called, you have to submit your documents like the DS-160 confirmation page, your passport, your photograph and your appointment confirmation letter. Next, your finger prints will be scanned. Finally, you will be called to be interviewed. There should not be any problem answering the interview questions if you have a valid reason to visit the US. Some of the interviewers (like mine) can be very friendly that you feel like it is more a chit-chat session than an interview session. At the end, the interviewer might tell you if your visa is approved or not.</p><p>After the interview, you can leave the embassy and wait for your passport to be delivered (hopefully with a visa inside).</p><h2 id=my-experience>My Experience</h2><p>There is not much to say about filling in DS-160 and making the payment. The day of the interview itself is more interesting. As mentioned, I arrived at the embassy 1 hour and 20 minutes before my interview, and 40 minutes before the first interview. As a result, I was the first in the queue among all that are in the same interview slot as me. My father was with me that time, but since I was already above 18 and he was not applying for a visa, he was initially not allowed to enter the embassy. However, after seeing him wander pointlessly outside the embassy, the guards just let him in. <img class=emoji title=smile alt=smile src=https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png height=20 width=20 align=absmiddle></p><p>The interviewer apparently had interviewed one of the other D-Coders.</p><p>Interviewer: Good morning! So why do you want to go to the United States?</p><p>Me: Good morning! I am going to the US to attend a coding bootcamp.</p><p>Interviewer: Oh! D-Code right?</p><p>Me: Yep. Here’s the invitation.</p><p>Interviewer: How did they select who to go to this bootcamp?</p><p>Me: There was another similar bootcamp earlier on, where we worked on some projects during that bootcamp, and they chose some of the best projects.</p><p>Interviewer: So what’s your project about?</p><p>Me: It’s a universal rating system.</p><p>Interviewer: Tell me more about it.</p><p>Me: Well, you know YouTube, they have their own rating system, right? (He nods.) But that rating system works only on YouTube. What we did was, this rating system basically works on all websites.</p><p>Interviewer: What does this rating means? I mean, what are your users actually rating?</p><p>Me: The quality of the content of the site that they are visiting.</p><p>Interviewer: Oh! I get it now. So you are asking your user to tell you what they think about the content?</p><p>Me: Yup, and then show the average score to the next user.</p><p>Interviewer: Interesting. How many people are there in your group?</p><p>Me: Just two.</p><p>Interviewer: And how many groups are there?</p><p>Me: A total of three groups are chosen to go to the US.</p><p>Interviewer: The expenses is paid by?</p><p>Me: StartupMalaysia. (Show him the scholarship terms and conditions.)</p><p>Interviewer: How long do you plan to stay in the US?</p><p>Me: About two weeks.</p><p>Interviewer: What are you doing in Malaysia, by the way? Working? Studying?</p><p>Me: I’m a student in Penang. (Show him the certification that I am a student.)</p><p>Interviewer: Ah. INTI Penang. What course are you doing there?</p><p>Me: I am doing my A-Levels there. It’s a pre-university course.</p><p>Interviewer: How long have you been there?</p><p>Me: Uh… About 8 months now.</p><p>Interviewer: Alright. Your visa is approved, you will be notified when your visa is ready, and you may collect your passport at the Penang office in 2-3 working days.</p><p>Me: Thanks.</p><p>I was then notified to collect my passport 2 days later. Inside my passport is a newly attached, 10-year, unlimited entries visa. <img class=emoji title=smile alt=smile src=https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smile.png height=20 width=20 align=absmiddle></p><h2 id=tips>Tips</h2><ol><li><p>Make a copy of everything, including the DS-160 form. You can later refer to this copy and at least not say something that contradicts with what you filled in.</p></li><li><p>Apply early. You never know when will be the next slot for you to be interviewed. For me, I have to wait for about 2 weeks to be interviewed. That is creepy enough already, as I will be travelling 2 weeks after the interview.</p></li><li><p>Start applying as soon as possible. You don’t have to wait for everything to be ready to start applying. Truth is, you don’t need any additional documents to fill in DS-160 and paying the fee. I knew that I will be travelling to the US 1 month before I started applying. But I did not apply, but wait for the invitation to be issued, that was 1 month later. Instead of waiting for the invitation, I can fill in DS-160 and pay the fee first, then schedule an appointment that I think the invitation is ready. Finally, reschedule the interview when the invitation is finally ready.</p></li><li><p>Having said that, don’t reschedule the interview excessively. You can only reschedule a finite (and not very large) number of times before your payment becomes invalid.</p></li><li><p>Print everything <strong>immediately</strong>. What I did was, I PDF everything that I think I need, then tag those files that need to be printed with a “Print” label. This might sound clever, until you missed out a file or two. I missed out the DS-160 confirmation. Fortunately, a friend of mine reminded me about that.</p></li></ol><div style=text-align:center><p><div data-role=spritzer></div></p></div><hr><footer role=contentinfo><div class=article-author-bottom><img src=http://www.yihangho.com/images/bio-photo.jpg class=bio-photo alt="Yihang Ho bio photo"><h3>Yihang Ho</h3><p>Coder</p><a href=http://twitter.com/yihang5 class=author-social target=_blank><i class=icon-twitter></i> Twitter</a> <a href=http://facebook.com/yihangho class=author-social target=_blank><i class=icon-facebook></i> Facebook</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YihangHo/" class=author-social target=_blank><i class=icon-google-plus></i> Google+</a> <a href=http://github.com/yihangho class=author-social target=_blank><i class=icon-github></i> Github</a> <a href=mailto:me@yihangho.com class=author-social target=_blank><i class=icon-mail></i> Email</a></div><p class=byline><strong>US Visa Application</strong> was published on <time datetime=2013-11-15T00:00:00+08:00 itemprop=datePublished>November 15, 2013</time> by <span itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><span itemprop=name><a href=http://www.yihangho.com/about title="About Yihang Ho" itemprop=url>Yihang Ho</a></span></span>.</p></footer></div></article></div><div class=footer-wrap><div class=related-articles><h4>You might also enjoy <small class=pull-right>(<a href=http://www.yihangho.com/articles>View all articles</a>)</small></h4><ul><li><a href=http://www.yihangho.com/raspberry-pi-vs-chromebook-for-education-use title="Raspberry Pi vs. Chromebook (for education use)">Raspberry Pi vs. Chromebook (for education use)</a></li><li><a href=http://www.yihangho.com/chrome-extension-development-in-a-nutshell title="Chrome Extension Development in a Nutshell">Chrome Extension Development in a Nutshell</a></li><li><a href=http://www.yihangho.com/d-code-bootcamp-silicon-valley-rushing-and-waiting title="D-Code Bootcamp Silicon Valley - Rushing and Waiting">D-Code Bootcamp Silicon Valley - Rushing and Waiting</a></li></ul><hr></div><footer><span>&copy; 2014 Yihang Ho.
