<h1 itemprop="name">Raspberry Pi vs. Chromebook (for education use)</h1>
<h2></h2>
</div><!--/ .headline-wrap -->
<div class="article-wrap" itemprop="text">
<p>In a previous post, I mentioned that I would prefer a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> over a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a> for students to learn coding. At first glance, both machines are cheap, not very powerful but portable. Let me go through each criteria that made me prefer a Pi over Chromebook.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi is a super portable (credit card size), single-board computer produced by the charitable Raspberry Pi Foundation. They produce two models of Raspberry Pi - Model A costs $25 while Model B costs $35. Both come with at least one USB port, HDMI output, RCA output and audio output. The only difference between Model A and Model B is that Model B comes with two USB ports, an Ethernet port and more RAM. Raspberry Pis do not have a built-in display nor any built-in input device. Also, it needs an SD card to boot up. Hence, these will be the added cost for using a Raspberry Pi. Personally, I own two Model B Pis.</p>

<p>Chromebook is a series of laptops (or netbooks) that runs on the Google Chrome OS. Chrome OS is Linux-based, but basically it contains only the Chrome browser. So what can be done on a web-browser can be done here; what cannot be done on a web-browser (most likely) cannot be done here.</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>As mentioned, a Raspberry Pi costs either $25 or $35. Assume that we take the more expensive Model B. Raspberry Pi does not include any display and input device - we have to buy that ourselves. For my configuration, I need neither - my Raspberry Pi is connected to my home network using the ethernet port, and I can SSH into my Pi to do stuff with it. However, in our scenario where these devices will be used by kids to do programming, we need both the display and input devices. For display device, this monster can easily cost more than $100. Hence, I would say that a fair estimate is about $200.</p>

<p>There are several models of Chromebook available. Their prices range from $199 to $1449. The model that I am using is called (according to official Chromebook site) <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/samsung-chromebook.html#ss-cb">Samsung Chromebook</a>. Let’s just assume we buy this model. It costs $249.</p>

<h2 id="availability-and-purchasing">Availability and Purchasing</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi is available worldwide through two of its reseller - RS electronics and Element 14. I ordered mine from Element 14. It ships to Malaysia FOC and arrives in about 3-4 working day. The overall experience was good.</p>

<p>Chromebooks are officially available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Hence, any other countries that is not in the list will either have to wait or to find ways purchasing through third party. The machine that I am using is actually sponsored by a corporate for our training program. So, don’t ask me how to get a Chromebook in Malaysia. I simply don’t know. <img class="emoji" title="worried" alt="worried" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/worried.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" /></p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>
<p>Frankly, setting up a Raspberry Pi is a lot of fun. On the hardware part, just connect your Pi to your TV via the HDMI cable, plug your keyboard and mouse into the USB port and use a micro-USB charger to power it up. (Yes, it is powered by any ordinary non-iPhone smartphone charger.) As for the software part, you will need to <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">download</a> the OS from Raspberry Pi site. There are three OSes available officially at the time of writing - Debian, Arch Linux and RISC OS (I have no idea what on Earth is this thing!). Next steps involve extracting a zip file and then write it to an SD card either by a GUI utility or the <code>dd</code> command. If you choose Debian, you are pretty much good to go after writing the OS to the SD card.</p>

<p>The Chromebook that I have is already configured when I received it. But from what I see on the internet, it is also quite simple, involves entering the password of your WiFi connection, entering your Google Account credential and stuff like that.</p>

<h2 id="carrying-around">Carrying Around</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi might seem to be more portable than Chromebook as it is only a credit card size device. But the reality is that, to make Raspberry Pi a useful device, we some some other peripherals like a display, mouse and keyboard, which makes Raspberry Pi harder to carry around.</p>

<h2 id="using-it-to-code">Using it to code</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi runs on Linux OSes like Debian and Arch. Hence, it is, in theory, possible to load any software that is available on these Linux distro. For example, classical editors like vi(m) and nano is available.</p>

<p>As for Chromebook, assuming that no modification is done, the rule of thumb is that what can be done any other modern web browser can be done on Chrome OS. The web-based IDE that I found is <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>. It comes with a decent code editor, terminal with git, C/C++ compiler, vim, and the usual Unix commands (no sudo though). Also, it integrates with GitHub and BitBucket so you can clone and work on your existing repository. The overall experience is acceptable, but the terminal is a bit laggy, which I guess is due to network latency.</p>

<p>Another web-based IDE that I found is <a href="https://koding.com">Koding</a>. It’s functionality is very similar to that of Cloud9 IDE. However, it does not support GitHub and BitBucket integration. Similar to Cloud9 IDE, the terminal is a little laggy, and there is no offline support.</p>

<h2 id="working-offline">Working offline</h2>
<p>Clearly, the only difference for Raspberry Pi between online and offline is the ability to Google or not. Writing codes and compiling them does not require any network connection (unless you are doing it like me - through SSH).</p>

<p>Chrome OS is more or less dead offline. Cloud9 IDE does not support offline coding editing. Hence, we will have to find another editor that works offline. I found <a href="https://write-box.appspot.com/">Writebox</a>. It works offline and can sync with Google Drive and Dropbox (not GitHub or BitBucket). Hence, you will have to manually copy/paste all the codes that you have written offline into Cloud9 IDE to test it out. Also, Writebox is actually not designed for code editing. So, no syntax highlighting in Writebox.</p>

<h2 id="other-usage-and-potential">Other Usage and Potential</h2>
<p>Again, Raspberry Pi is running on Linux. Hence, in terms of software, it has virtually infinite possibility. For example, it can be used as a low volume web server, NAS, print server, FTP server, personal media centre, etc. Besides being a very small computer, it is also possible to do some hardware hacking on Raspberry Pi. The GPIO ports allow users to tweak and add more functionality to Raspberry Pi. Also, the Raspberry Pi Foundation recently launched a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/3890">camera board</a> for Raspberry Pi, which expands Raspberry Pi’s potential further.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is not much to do for a Chromebook on both the software and the hardware. However, it is possible to switch on the developer mode on a Chromebook and open up more functionalities like the sudo command or installing some other OS like Ubuntu as mentioned at the beginning of this post.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we can see, Raspberry Pi and Chromebooks win over one another in various aspects. I shall summarize this analysis with a table:</p>

<p>There is no clear cut for the fight between Raspberry Pi and Chromebook. Both are very suitable for educational use as they are cheap but of good quality. Personally, I prefer Raspberry Pi over Chromebook as I prefer fiddling with the Linux. Also, I was able to learn a great load of Linux stuff when playing around with Raspberry Pi. For example, I learnt to set up the Apache web server, which was very helpful later on during my internship with a web development company.</p>
